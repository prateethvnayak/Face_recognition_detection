Face Detection and Recognition Using Harr-Cascade LPBH


Implementation of Face Detection using Harr-Cacade features in openCV lib. 

Also, using the laptop video camera to capture faces and create a database. 

Implementing the Face Recognition algorithm using LPBH (local Pattern binary histo) to recognize faces in the real time video with boundary boxed indicating person name.
